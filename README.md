# My Scripts

This repo just contains some simple scripts that I've written to make my life a
little easier. It's currently not organized in any particular way, but feel free
to poke around and find anything useful to yourself!

# Compatibility 

These scripts were written for [PopOS 21.04](https://pop.system76.com/) and have
been tested in that environment. Your mileage may vary in other Linux/Unix-like
environments.
